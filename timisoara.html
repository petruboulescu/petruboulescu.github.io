        <p id="firstPara">Timișoara is the capital city of Timiș County and the main economic, social and
            cultural center in western Romania. Located on the Bega River, Timișoara is considered the informal capital
            city of the historical Banat. From 1848 to 1860 it was the capital of the Serbian Vojvodina and the
            Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar.

            With 319,279 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Timișoara was then the country's third most populous city,
            after Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca. It is home to almost half a million inhabitants in its metropolitan area,
            while the Timișoara–Arad conurbation concentrates more than 70% of the population of Timiș and Arad
            counties. Timișoara is a multicultural city, being the home of 21 different ethnicities and 18 religions.
            Interculturality has long been a special characteristic for the western part of the country.

            Conquered in 1716 by the Austrians from the Ottoman Turks, Timișoara developed in the following centuries
            behind the fortifications and in the urban nuclei located around them. During the second half of the 19th
            century, the fortress began to lose its usefulness, due to many developments in the military technology.
            Former bastions and military spaces were demolished and replaced with new boulevards and neighborhoods.
            Timișoara was the first city in the Habsburg Monarchy with street lighting (1760) and the first European
            city to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884.It opened the first public lending library in the
            Habsburg Monarchy and built a municipal hospital 24 years before Vienna.Also, it published the first
            German newspaper in Southeast Europe (Temeswarer Nachrichten).Timișoara was the starting point of the
            Romanian Revolution.

        </p>

        <p>Timișoara is one of the most important educational centers in Romania, with about 40,000 students enrolled
            in the city's six universities. Like many other large cities in Romania, Timișoara is a medical tourism
            service provider, especially for dental care and cosmetic surgery.Timișoara has made several
            breakthroughs in Romanian medicine, including the first in vitro fertilization, the first laser heart
            surgery and the first stem cell transplant.As a technology hub, the city has one of the most powerful
            IT sectors in Romania alongside Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iași and Brașov. In 2013 Timișoara had the fastest
            internet download speed in the world.

            Nicknamed the "Little Vienna" or the "City of Flowers", Timișoara is noted for its large number of
            historical monuments and its 36 parks and green spaces.Along with Oradea, Timișoara is part of the Art
            Nouveau European Route.It is also a member of Eurocities.Timișoara has a very active cultural
            scene thanks to the city's three state theaters, opera, philharmonic and many other cultural institutions.
            The city will be the next European Capital of Culture in 2023.</p>

        <p> Archaeological finds from a medieval cemetery show that a community of warriors settled in the region west
            of the present-day town in the second half of the 10th century.Almost half of the 41 graves yielded
            grave goods (including arrow heads, hair rings, earrings and bracelets), suggesting that those who were
            buried in the cemetery persisted with their pagan rites.The placing of arrow heads into graves is well
            documented among 10th-century Hungarian warriors in the Carpathian Basin.The position of the arm bones
            in ten graves may indicates that Christians or people influenced by Christianity were also buried in the
            cemetery.Various types of rings point at commercial contacts between the local inhabitants and the
            Balkan Peninsula.The cemetery was abandoned in the first decades of the 11th century.

            The mid-12th-century Muslim geographer, Muhammad al-Idrisi, mentioned a town named "T.n.y.s.b.r" and
            described it as a prosperous settlement, located to the south of the river "T.y.s.y.a", or Tisza.
            Historian István Petrovics associates T.n.y.s.b.r with Temesvár, suggesting that Idrisi mislocated it
            because he had no direct information of the town.Timișoara was named after a fortress: the Hungarian
            name of the town, Temesvár, refers to a castle (vár) on the river Timiș (Temes).The fortress was first
            mentioned in the Register of Arad around 1177.The document mentioned two villages, "Sep" and "Vrman",
            on the royal estates attached to the fortress "Demesiensis".It was most probably made of earth and
            timber, according to historian Ferenc Sebők.The fortress, which was erected on a swampy land, near a
            tributary of the Temes, the Bega, was the seat of the ispán, or head of Temes County.In 1241 the city
            was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary and Poland, but the walls were rebuilt.

            Charles I of Hungary took up his residence in Temesvár in 1315, because a dozen powerful lords who had
            refused to yield to him controlled large territories in other parts of Hungary.In the next years, a
            royal castle was erected near the old fortress and the latter was rebuilt with stone.According to
            Petrovics, the church dedicated to Saint Eligius implies that Italian artisans settled in the town during
            this period, because the saint was primarily venerated in Naples.The Dominicans settled in the town
            before Csanád Telegdi was consecrated bishop in their local church in early 1323.After Charles I
            restored royal authority, he transferred his court from Temesvár to the centrally-located Visegrád in the
            summer of 1323.

            The "guest settlers" in the town (hospites de Themeswar) were first mentioned in 1341, the burghers of
            Timișoara (cives de Temeswar) in 1342.The ethnicity of the citizens was rarely mentioned, but their
            names suggest that most "guest settlers" and burghers were Hungarians.Records of citizens who moved
            from Șemlacu Mare, Maráz and other nearby villages to Temesvár prove that it had developed into an important
            regional center. Merchants from Ragusa (now Dubrovnik in Croatia) settled in the town around 1402.
            Bulgarians, Romanians and Serbians also moved to the town in the 15th and 16th centuries.For instance,
            the name of Johannes Olaah ("John the Vlach"), who was a burgher of Temesvár in 1539, suggests that he was
            of Romanian origin.

            By the middle of the 14th century, Temesvár was at the forefront of Western Christendom's battle against the
            Muslim Ottoman Turks. French and Hungarian crusaders met at the city before engaging in the Battle of
            Nicopolis in 1396. Beginning in 1443, John Hunyadi used Temesvár as a military stronghold against the Turks,
            having built a powerful fortress. The city was repeatedly sieged by the Ottomans in 1462, 1476, 1491, and
            1522.

            In 1514 the largest peasants' revolt in Hungarian history was defeated in a battle near Temesvár and its
            Székely leader György Dózsa was tortured and executed.</p>

        <p> Because of Temesvár's strategic location, the Ottomans desired to capture the fortress during their
            campaigns against the Kingdom of Hungary. Although the Hungarians suffered a devastating loss at the Battle
            of Mohács in 1526, Temesvár was not conquered by the Ottomans until October 1551.

            The city was transformed into the administrative centre of an Ottoman province, the Province of Temeşvar .
            The fortress was rebuilt and, along with Belgrade, used as a major military base by the Ottomans. Because of
            its military orientation, the city itself developed slowly during the Ottoman administration. Timișoara had
            two fortified parts: the castle and the city, which was surrounded by wooden and stone walls. 200 guns were
            used to defend the city as well as water trenches around the walls. Approximately 1,200 houses, schools,
            hotels, and public baths were to be found inside the walls, while outside the walls around 1,500 other
            houses were present.

            The Ottomans surrendered the city to the Habsburg Imperial armies led by Prince Eugene of Savoy on 12
            October 1716 during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18. Prince Eugene entered the city on October 18 and
            named one of his officers, Claudius Florimund Mercy, as governor of the city. Because the town had burned
            down during the siege, the city was completely rebuilt under Mercy's supervision. Temesvár was officially
            conceded to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy by the Ottomans in the Treaty of Passarowitz of 1718. Temesvár
            became the capital of the Banat of Temeswar, a separate Habsburg province. The province was abolished in
            1778, reincorporated into Kingdom of Hungary.

            Under Habsburg rule, a new stone fortress was built around the city in 1723. Inside the walls houses,
            hospitals, schools, and churches were being raised, while outside the city factories were being opened. By
            the 1720 data, most of the inhabitants of the town were ethnic Serbs, and also some Romanians. Later,
            German, Italian, and Spanish settlers were brought in to settle in the area. The marshland around the city
            was reclaimed, while the rivers Bega and Temes became regulated. The city remained a military stronghold
            with a large garrison. This period was one of strong economic development and population increases. By 1781
            Temesvár was one of the most important cities of the Habsburg Monarchy and as such it received a royal free
            city warrant which would accelerate the development of the city even further. Because of the Habsburg
            administration, Temesvár was often referred to by the German names Temeschburg, meaning "castle (Burg) on
            the Temes" or Temeschwar, based on the Hungarian Temesvár. Temesvár was captured in 1788 and looted by
            Ottomans in 1789 during Austro-Turkish War (1788–1791).

            During the Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries took over the Hungarian government. Because the Austrian
            commander of the city's garrison decided to defend the Habsburg interests, the Hungarian army began an
            unsuccessful siege of Temesvár that lasted for 114 days. In the later stage of the revolution, the city was
            captured by the Serbian troops and for a short time was a capital of the Serbian Vojvodina.

            The development of the city continued after the attempted 1848/1849 revolution. In 1849, Temesvár became the
            capital of the new Habsburg province named Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat. The province was abolished
            in 1860. The city became capital of Temes County after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 which united
            the administrations of the region with those of the Kingdom of Hungary.

            In 1853 telegraphy was introduced in the city, and in 1857 Timișoara received gas street lighting. In 1857 a
            train line linking Temesvár with Szeged was constructed, and in 1867 horse trams were introduced in the
            city. The Hungarian city of Temesvár became the first European city to have electric street lights in 1884,
            while the trams became electric in 1899 (after Bucharest in 1884). Temesvár was also the first city in the
            Kingdom of Hungary and later Romania to have an ambulance station.

            After World War I, following an ephemerous pro-Hungary Banat Republic, and occupation by the Serbian Army,
            Timișoara was incorporated into the Kingdom of Romania in 1919 together with most of the Banat region.

            In December 1989 a popular uprising began in Timișoara against the Communist regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu.
            The Hungarian Calvinist pastor László Tőkés was ordered to be deported by the Securitate, or secret police,
            and as a reaction his house was surrounded by members of his church. People supporting him, including people
            of Romanian origin, gathered at the central square (Opera Square). The Communist administration ordered the
            army to fire at the congregation. However, a number of army officers refused to open fire and sided with the
            people. That was the beginning of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which ended the Communist regime a week
            later. Timișoara was declared the first Free Town on 20 December 1989, suffering 130 reported deaths and
            3,352 wounded during the revolution</p>

        <p>Like all of Romania, Timișoara exhibits a temperate continental climate, characteristic of the southeastern
            part of the Pannonian Basin, with some sub-Mediterranean influences. The Köppen climate classification
            subtype for this climate is Cfb (oceanic climate).

            The dominant air masses, during spring and summer, are the temperate ones, of oceanic origin, which bring
            significant precipitations. Frequently, even in winter, humid air masses arrive from the Atlantic, bringing
            significant rains and snows, less often cold waves. From September to February there are frequent
            penetrations of continental polar air masses, coming from the east. However, in Banat the influence of
            cyclones and hot air masses from the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea is also strongly felt, which in
            winter generate complete thawing and in summer impose periods of stifling heat.

            The average annual temperature is 12.4°C (2007), constantly rising.The warmest month, on average, is
            July with an average temperature of 21.7°C. The coolest month on average is January, with an average
            temperature of –1.7°C.The lowest temperature recorded in Timișoara was –35.3°C, on 24 January 1963,
            while the highest temperature was 42°C, recorded in August 2017.The average number of frost days (with
            minimum temperatures below 0°C) is 91, and the average number of winter days (with maximum temperatures
            below 0°C) is 22.4. The average number of tropical days (with maximum temperatures above 30°C) is 40.

            Being predominantly under the influence of the maritime air masses from the northwest, Timișoara receives a
            higher amount of precipitation than the cities in the Wallachian Plain.The average amount of
            precipitation for the year in Timișoara is 649.2 mm (2007).The month with the most precipitation on
            average is June with 81.3 mm of precipitation. The month with the least precipitation on average is January
            with an average of 40.6 mm.In terms of liquid precipitation, there are an average of 69.1 days of rain,
            with the most rain occurring in June with 7.6 days of rain, and the least rain occurring in March with five
            days of rain.</p>
