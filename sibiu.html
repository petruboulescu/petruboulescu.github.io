              <p>The Romanian name Sibiu derives from the city's Latin name of Cibinium, which is also the source of the Cibin river's name. An archaic version of the name is Sibiiu, while an obsolete folk name is Sâghii, also spelled Sîghii.</p>

              <p>Sibiu is situated near the geographical center of Romania at 45.792784°N 24.152069°E. Set in the Cibin Depression, the city is about 20 km from the Făgăraș Mountains, 12 km from the Cibin Mountains, and about 15 km from the Lotru Mountains, which border the depression in its southwestern section. The northern and eastern limits of Sibiu are formed by the Târnavelor Plateau, which descends to the Cibin Valley through Gușteriței Hill. The Cibin river as well as some smaller streams runs through Sibiu. The geographical position of Sibiu makes it one of the most important transportation hubs in Romania with important roads and railway lines passing through it.</p>
